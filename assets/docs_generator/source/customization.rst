Customization
=============

There are a couple of special attributes that you can apply to your class members to provide some easy inspector customization.


=============================   ======================================================================
**Attribute**                   **Description**
-----------------------------   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

[HideInInspector]				Force a field or property to be hidden in the inspector. Only public fields/properties are shown by default.

[InspectorButton]				Draw the method as a button in the inspector.

[InspectorComment]				Add a comment below the given field/property/type

[InspectorDisabled]				Draw the inspector with a disabled GUI, so that the user cannot interact with it.

[InspectorDivider]				Draw a divider in the inspector.

[InspectorHeader]				Draw a header above the given field or attribute with some nice text to go along with the header.

[InspectorHidden]				Donâ€™t show this attribute in the inspector (by default, every member is shown, even private ones)

[InspectorHidePrimary]			Hide the primary editor, only showing the attribute ones. This is primarily used to draw a margin or a comment that stands alone.

[InspectorIndent]				Indent the given field or property in the inspector.

[InspectorMargin]				Add space above the given field/property

[InspectorName]					Give the field, property, or method a custom name in the inspector.

[InspectorOrder]				Foricbly specify the order to display the field, property, or method.

[InspectorSkipInheritance]		Do not show the inheritance drop-down.

[InspectorTextArea]				Draw the string using a fixed-height text area.

[InspectorTooltip]				Add a tooltip to the given field, property, or method.

[NotSerialized]					Do not serialize this field or property. Identical to NonSerialized, except that it can also be applied to properties.

[ShowInInspector]				Force a field or property to be displayed in the inspector. Non-public fields/properties are not shown by default.

[VerifyPrefabType]				Verify that the given ``UnityObject`` reference has the given prefab type.

Please see ``fiSettings`` to customize how Full Inspector operates. It is located at *FullInspector2/fiSettings.cs*. The settings are all contained within fiSettings

`fiSettings`, with it's default values, is duplicated below:
