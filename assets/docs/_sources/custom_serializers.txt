Custom Serializers
==================

You have a serialization framework and want to use it inside of Full Inspector; how do you do that? Luckily, Full Inspector (since 1.1) has fantastic support for third party serializers.

The current serializers are located in *"FullInspector2/Serializers"*. Feel free to take a look at the existing ones.

The process to create a new serializer is simple. Simply derive from ``BaseSerializer`` and implement the abstract methods. If you come across a ``UnityEngine.Object`` (or derived type) reference, make sure to serialize it using ``SerializationHelpers.StoreObjectReference`` and deserialize it using ``SerializationHelpers.RetrieveObjectReference``. This ensures that the object reference will be treated correctly, when, e.g., the object becomes a prefab.

Lets say you created a new serializer called ``MySerializer``. How do you actually use it? Simple: derive from ``BaseBehavior<MySerializer>``. That's it.
