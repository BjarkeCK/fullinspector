# Object Backups

Full Inspector has one of the most powerful object backup systems around. It allows you to quickly save the state of an object, make a few test modifications, and then restore that state if you wish. You can have multiple saved states, and best of all you can save in play-mode and restore in edit-mode.

- Save in play-mode and restore in edit-mode
- Only restore some properties
- Create as many backups as you like; delete them at will
