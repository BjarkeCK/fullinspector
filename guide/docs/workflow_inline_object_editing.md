# Inline Object Editing

If you have a reference to a type that has a `BehaviorEditor`, for example, a `BaseBehavior` or `BaseScriptableObject` derived type, then when you view a reference to it in the inspector you will have the option to display the inspector inline right beneath the reference by expanding the foldout arrow.
